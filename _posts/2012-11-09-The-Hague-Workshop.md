title: NodeBox 3 The Hague Workshop
---
We just finished teaching a NodeBox 3 data visualisation workshop at the [Royal Academy of Art, The Hague](http://www.kabk.nl/) for a small but enthusiastic group of 3rd- and 4th year students.

You can [view the final results](http://nodebox.net/gallery/2012/11/workshop-the-hague/) in the NodeBox gallery.
