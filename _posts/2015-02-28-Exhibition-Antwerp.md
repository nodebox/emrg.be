EMRG, together with the Dutch duo [Driessens & Verstappen](http://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/), organise an exhibition in Showroom, Antwerp!

The theme is <em>“visualizing the invisible”</em>, and we’ve been working on visualising the electromagnetic spectrum. If you’ve ever wanted to experience radio waves in 3D using virtual reality goggles, now’s your chance!

The exhibition opens on Friday, March 6th 2015 at 19:00 in Showroom, Kerkstraat 45, Antwerp. The exhibition itself is on Saturday and Sunday, between 14:00 and 18:00.
