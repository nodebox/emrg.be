Sint Lucas Antwerp and EMRG organize courses NodeBox for the **second and third bachelor**. Courses are open for students graphic design, illustration and advertising.  The courses are usually for a limited amount of time (during one semester) and are centralized around one of more specific topics such as **generative design, datavisualization or experimental typography**.

Students willing to take a dive even further in the deep are encouraged to implement NodeBox as a tool within their master research. We had students experimenting with real time audio video performance, design based on Twitter activity and drawings based on text and sentiment analysis over the past few years.
