  <h2>NodeBox</h2>

  <p>NodeBox was initiated as a research project and grew out of frustration with existing design tools.</p>
  <p>NodeBox is now a serious playground for research in design automation and AI, with many libraries.</p>
  <p>It has since evolved into a new tool, called NodeBox 2.</p>

  <h2>NodeBox 2</h2>

  <p>Even though it looks like a small version number change, NodeBox 2 is quite a different beast from NodeBox 1. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions.</p>
  <p>NodeBox 2 is free software (under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>) and cross-platform, running on Mac, Windows and Linux.</p>
