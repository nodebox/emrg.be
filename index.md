The Experimental Media Research Group is part of [Sint Lucas Antwerpen](http://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/), the art department of the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be).

EMRG (pronounced as "emerge") is a research group investigating the role of computers in graphic design and art since 2004. We are gradually promoting the computer from a pure production tool into a creative partner, thereby empowering designers and/or artists  to focus on the interesting aspects of their work.
  
We are developing a number of open-source tools used by graphic designers, the generative art community and scientists who are in need of visualizing huge amounts of research data.

We teach these tools to graphic design and fine arts students at our host institute and worldwide through workshops at art schools or private businesses.

We are able to do this by acquiring competitive funding, competitive project proposals and social services.
