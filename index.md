The Experimental Media Research Group is part of [Sint Lucas Antwerpen](http://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/), the art department of the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be).

EMRG (pronounced as "emerge") is a research group investigating the role of computers in graphic design and art since 2004. We are gradually promoting the computer from a pure production tool into a creative partner, thereby empowering designers and/or artists  to focus on the interesting aspects of their work.
  
We are developing a number of open-source tools used by graphic designers, the generative art community and scientists who are in need of visualizing huge amounts of research data.

We teach these tools to graphic design and fine arts students at our host institute and worldwide through workshops at art schools or private businesses.

We are able to do this by acquiring competitive funding, competitive project proposals and social services.
  
NodeBox 3
---------
NodeBox 3 is a cross-platform, free software application for creating generative graphics using an easy-to-use node-based UI. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions.

NodeBox 3 runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. It is under active development.

NodeBox 2 (development stopped)
---------
NodeBox 2 is a cross-platform, free software application for creating generative graphics using an easy-to-use node-based UI. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions. Experience through workshops and user feedback led to a new approach and NodeBox 3

NodeBox 2 runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. Actual development has stopped.

NodeBox/OpenGL
---------
NodeBox/OpenGL was initiated as part of a research project called "City in a bottle". The need for real time speed in developing a game led to the development of NodeBox/OpenGL.

NodeBox 1
---------
NodeBox 1 was initiated as a research project and grew out of frustration with existing design tools. NodeBox is now a serious playground for research in design automation and AI, with many libraries. It has since evolved into a new tool, called NodeBox 2.
