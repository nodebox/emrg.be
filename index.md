The EMRG is a research group investigating the role of computers in design. We are gradually promoting the computer from a pure production tool into a creative partner, thereby empowering designers to focus on the interesting aspects of their work.
  
We are developing a number of open-source tools used by graphics designers and the generative art community.
  
NodeBox 3
---------
NodeBox 3 is a cross-platform, free software application for creating generative graphics using an easy-to-use node-based UI. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions.

NodeBox 3 runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. It is under active development.

NodeBox 1
---------
NodeBox 1 was initiated as a research project and grew out of frustration with existing design tools. NodeBox is now a serious playground for research in design automation and AI, with many libraries. It has since evolved into a new tool, called NodeBox 2.
