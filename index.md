**EMRG** is a cross-domain research group associated with the [Sint Lucas School of arts](http://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/) of the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be) (Antwerp, Belgium). EMRG has been active since 2004.

**EMRG** specializes in computer graphics applications and cutting-edge research in the domain of computer graphics, user experience, creativity, but also in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Most of the EMRG research is based on competitively acquired funding, including funding agencies such as the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, the Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology, and private companies.

**EMRG** is pronounced _emerge_. Emergence or self-organization can be observed in for example ant colonies, the weather and the economy. It is also a common feature of _generative art_, art produced by algorithms and inspired by self-organization. A key theme in our research is the role of computers in (visual) communication. With the WWW availability of information has grown immensely and consequently computers are playing a dominant role in the way humans process information. Our aim is to promote the computer from a production tool to an emergent/creative partner that helps extract, process and present information.

**EMRG** is passionate about open source software. Most of our tools are free or have licenses interesting to artistic, scientific, non-profit as well as commercial organizations.

**EMRG** is passionate about teaching. We are internationally recognized for our lectures and workshops inspiring the next generation of digital innovators.
