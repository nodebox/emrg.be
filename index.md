**EMRG** (Experimental Research Group) is a cross-domain research group associated with the [Sint Lucas School of arts](http://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/) of the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be) (Antwerp, Belgium). EMRG has been active since 2004.

**EMRG** specializes in computer graphics applications and cutting-edge research in the domain of computer graphics, creativity, user experience, artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Most of the EMRG research is based on competitively acquired funding, including funding agencies such as the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, the Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology, and private companies.

**EMRG** is pronounced as "emerge". The principle of emergence can be observed in for example ant colonies, the weather, the economy. It is also a common hallmark of generative art â€“ art produced by algorithms and inspired by self-organization. A key theme in our research is to investigate the role of machines in visual communication and art. With the WWW, availability of information has grown substantially and consequently machines and visual communication tools have come to play a dominant role in the way humans process information. Our aim is to promote the computer from a production tool to a creative partner that helps to process such stimuli.

**EMRG** is passionate about open source software. Most of our tools have free or competitive licenses, interesting to artistic, scientific, non-profit as well as commercial organizations.

**EMRG** is passionate about teaching. We are internationally recognized for our lectures and workshops inspiring the next generation of innovators.
