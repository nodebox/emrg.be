title: Experimental Media Research Group

The EMRG is a research group investigating the role of computers in design. We are gradually promoting the computer from a pure production tool into a creative partner, thereby empowering designers to focus on the interesting aspects of their work.
  
We are developing a number of open-source tools used by graphics designers and the generative art community.
  
NodeBox
-------
NodeBox was initiated as a research project and grew out of frustration with existing design tools. NodeBox is now a serious playground for research in design automation and AI, with many libraries. It has since evolved into a new tool, called NodeBox 2.

NodeBox 2
---------
Even though it looks like a small version number change, NodeBox 2 is quite a different beast from NodeBox 1. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions.

NodeBox 2 is free software (under the [GNU Public License][gpl]) and cross-platform, running on Mac, Windows and Linux.
