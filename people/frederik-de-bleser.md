Frederik is co-founder of EMRG and the author of NodeBox. He owns a private design company called Burocrazy. His PhD research studies the link between computers and art: the impact of procedural graphics applications on graphic designers. Specifically, if designers using this software are:

1. Efficient: can designers produce good designs faster?
2. Comprehensive: can they try out more things before settling on a finished design?
3. Creative: can they produce new things beyond the state-of-the-art?
4. Self-reliant: are they able to help themselves if they get stuck?
