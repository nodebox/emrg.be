<h3>Abstract</h3>
Conduit is a pending funding proposal. The project envisions the computer as a _bicycle for the mind_ (Jobs, 1984) instead of a box with a display, mouse and keyboard. Using the computer as a central pivot, we want to make it as easy as possible to different forms of input to different forms of output: for example social network data and EEG signals to games, infographics and laser cutters. Conduit provides provide flexible tools to visualize and externalize data to other (physical) forms. The project introduces new possibilities for designers to sketch with data, for dancers to link their movement to projections, for people with physical disabilities to express themselves creatively, etc. All of these create a bridge between disciplines and make unexpected collaborations possible.
