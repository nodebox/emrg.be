Conduit is a new research project within EMRG. It sees the computer more as a "bicycle of the mind" (Jobs, 1984): no longer as a box with a screen, mouse and keyboard but as **a central pivot to a connected whole**.

We want to make it as easy as possible to **link the computer to input from the outside**, linking it to social network data or signals from a brain helmet or video stream. Once you have the data we provide simple tools to **visualize** and **externalize** it to other (physical) forms through laser cutters and 3D printing.

This research introduces new possibilities for designers to sketch with data, for dancers to link their movement to projections, for people with physical disabilities to express themselves creatively. All of these create a bridge between disciplines and make unexpected collaborations possible.

In practice we want to:

* Extend NodeBox to be a **real-time tool**.
* Provide nodes for **hardware devices**.
* Provide nodes for **collecting, aggregating and searching data**.
* Provide visualizations **feedback loops**.
* Accomplish **interdisciplinary projects** with artists from all fields.
