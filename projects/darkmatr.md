DarkMatr is **an interactive installation** that used the web as if it was a database for collective human intelligence. Using data vizualisation graphics, cinema immersion, open source software and new media (thermal camera and biofilm screen), the human body became a physical interface to connect with the virtualized knowledge of the net.

DarkMatr investigated the way data from the web and our physical world can be merged and presented in a total user experience.
Nodebox and some of the libraries were used to create a **repository of information and content** linked to all nouns in the english language.

DarkMatr was an **Art&D project funded by the IBBT** (Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology, Ghent, Belgium) and by the VGC (Flemish Community Commission of Brussels) and had the support of 

* EMRG Nodebox (KdG, Antwerp)
* CUO (University of Leuven, Belgium)
* Wica (University of Gent)
* iMAL (Center for Digital Cultures and Technology, Brussels)
* Nadine/Plateau

It received additional support of XenICs and Jemaco.

DarkMatr, a project **produced by Tom Heene** in collaboration **with  Pieter Heremans, Lieven Menschaert, Lionel Maes, Olivier Meunier, Gert Aertsen and Dries De Roeck**.
