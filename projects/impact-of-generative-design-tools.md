<h3>Abstract</h3>
Frederik De Bleser's PhD thesis investigates the impact of procedural graphics applications such as <a href="http://nodebox.net/" class="tag-software">NodeBox</a> on graphic designers. Specifically we want to know if designers using this software are:

1. Efficient: can designers produce good designs faster?
2. Comprehensive: can they try out more things before settling on a finished design?
3. Creative: can they produce new things beyond the state of the art?
4. Self-reliant: are they able to help themselves if they get stuck?

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
