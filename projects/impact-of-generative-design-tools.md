title: Impact of generative design tools
---
This project researches the impact of procedural graphics applications such as [NodeBox][] on graphic designers. Specifically we want to know if designers using this software are:

* **More efficient**: can designers produce good designs faster?
* **More comprehensive**: can they try out more things before settling on a finished design?
* **More creative**: can they produce new things beyond the state of the art?
* **Self-reliant**: are they able to help themselves if they get stuck?

Research results are available on [the blog][enigmeta].
