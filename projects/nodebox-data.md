title: NodeBox / Data
---
NodeBox / Data researches data-driven design. It asks the question if we can let our design be driven by *data* instead of just out of the blue.

It does this by integrating a data component inside the NodeBox application. All nodes will be able to accept and send data. Not just geometric shapes, but any kind of data. Other nodes can react on it, and finally transform it into some visual representation.
