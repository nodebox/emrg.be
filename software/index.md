The EMRG develops the following software projects:


NodeBox 3
---------
NodeBox 3 is a cross-platform, free software application for creating generative graphics using an easy-to-use node-based UI. Instead of writing code, users can connect visual blocks, which we call nodes, together into networks, creating visually rich compositions.

NodeBox 3 runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. It is under active development.

NodeBox 2 (development stopped)
---------
NodeBox 2 started the conversion from code to a node-based UI. Experience through workshops and user feedback led to a new approach and NodeBox 3.

NodeBox 2 runs on Mac, Windows and Linux. Actual development has stopped.


NodeBox/OpenGL
--------------
NodeBox/OpenGL was initiated as part of a research project called "City in a bottle". The need for real time speed in developing a game led to the development of NodeBox/OpenGL. It is a hardware-accelerated, cross-platform version of NodeBox 1 minus the graphical user interface.

NodeBox 1
---------
NodeBox 1 was initiated as a research project and grew out of frustration with existing design tools. NodeBox is now a serious playground for research in design automation and AI, with many libraries. 

NodeBox 1 is in "maintenace mode" where we only release new versions to fix critical issues.
