NodeBox is a Mac OS X application that lets you create 2D visuals (static, animated or interactive) using Python programming code and export them as a PDF or a QuickTime movie. NodeBox is free and well-documented.

NodeBox 1 is only available for Mac OS X, but ports exist for other platforms that use the same API such as [Shoebot][].

*NodeBox 1 is no longer under active development.*
