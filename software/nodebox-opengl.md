title: NodeBox for OpenGL

[NodeBox for OpenGL][nogl] is a free, cross-platform library for generating 2D animations with Python programming code.

It is built on the [Pyglet][] library and the API is near-identical to NodeBox for Mac OS X. There's no GUI or anything but it has built-in support for paths, layers, motion tweening, hardware-accelerated image effects, simple physics and interactivity.
